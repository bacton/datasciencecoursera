Analysis Files for "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Dataset"
==================================================================

This submission consists of the following files:
================================================
- 'README.txt': This file.
- 'run_analysis.R': An R script file that performs all of the computations
required.
- 'Code-Book.csv': A CSV file that contains a description of all variables
of the dataframe generated by the 'run_analysis.R' script.

To perform the requested analysis:
==================================
(1) Download this file:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
(2) Unzip the file referenced in (1) on your computer's hard drive. A
subdirectory named 'UCI HAR Dataset' will be created.
(3) Copy the R script named 'run_analysis.R' into the 'UCI HAR Dataset'
subdirectory. If not executing this script from RStudio, you may have to change
the file permissions of 'run_analysis.R' so that it is executable.
(4) Ensure that the following R packages have been installed into your R
environment:
- data.table
- dplyr
- dtplyr
(5) Inside your R environment (e.g. RStudio), set the working directory to 
'UCI HAR Dataset'. 
(6) From the (e.g.) RStudio console, execute the following commands:
(i) source("run_analysis.R")
(ii) cleaned_data_set <- clean_data_set() 
[any other name for the returned dataframe is also OK]
(7) The dataframe returned in (6-ii) is the final, tidy data set with the
average of each variable, ordered by each activity and each subject, as
per the requirements.

Notes:
======
(1) Variables in the UCI HAR Dataset whose name did not contain either the
string 'mean' or the string 'std', were dropped from the analysis and not
included in the final, tidy dataframe.
(2) Variables 555-561 in the input dataset, documented in the 'features.txt'
file, and listed here:
- angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)
- angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)
- angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)
- angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)
- angle(X,gravityMean)
- angle(Y,gravityMean)
- angle(Z,gravityMean)
...were dropped from the analysis, as these particular measurements appear to
be derived from the mean and standard deviation of other measurements, and do
not appear to be actual measurements themselves.
